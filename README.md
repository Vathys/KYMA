WEEKLY UPDATES
================================================================================================================================================
// 2/6/17 - 2/10/17

*Started working on the shop, so far only visually.

// 2/13/17 - 2/17/17

*Fixed the new Triangle Class which allows us to draw multiple Traiangles with ease by using the graphic's drawPolygon method.
*Added the ability to change the Window's Cursor, which can be a possible cosmetic upgrade in shop.
*Added an animated coin that work's similar to a gif file by constatnly switching between various layers of pitcures.
*The coin will be used as the game's currency, and so far the player is able to collide with it and pick it up.
*Now that we have a triangle function, we are thinking of creating new enemies and bosses with them in order to increase variety.

// 2/20/17 - 2/24/17

*Started working on the Shop again.
*The arrows that decrease and increase stats work, but thay are not capable of changing the player's actual stats yet.
